# 1. Draw tic-tac-toe board.
# 2. Add board and playing loop.
# 3. Add click-to-play.
# 4. Add check for a win.
# 5. Require play on empty square. (And change empty representation
#    from "E" to "" because it makes board easier to read.)
# 6. Add computer player.
# 7. Generalize program to play n-by-n, not 3-by-3, tic-tac-toe.
#    ... coming soon ...
