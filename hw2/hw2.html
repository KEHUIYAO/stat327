<p>Here we estimate pi by the method discussed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration</a>. All you need to read there is the first paragraph and the first figure and its caption. We will do this with the help of two functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>magnitude(x, y), a helper function to be called by monte.carlo.pi(), below, that returns the distance of the point (x, y) to the origin</li>
<li>monte.carlo.pi(n , draw=FALSE), which estimates pi from n random points and optionally draws a picture of the simulation</li>
</ul>
<pre><code># Description: magnitude returns the distance a of point (x, y) from
#   the origin (or a vector of such distances if x and y are vectors).
# Usage: magnitude(x, y)
# Arguments:
#   x: x-coordinate of one point (or x-coordinates of several points)
#   y: y-coordinate of one point (or y-coordinates of several points)
#      (must have same length as x)

<pre><code># Description: monte.carlo.pi estimates pi by simulation.
# Usage: monte.carlo.pi(n, draw=FALSE)
# Arguments:
#   n: number of random points to use
#   draw: logical, whether or not to draw a graph of the simulation
#     consisting of the n points and the unit circle.
# Details: The simulation proceeds by getting n random points {(x, y)}
#   in the square defined by -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 and -1 &lt; y &lt; 1, and then
#   counting how many of those points are within a radius 1 of (0, 0).
#   We can use
#     (area of circle)/(area of square) = pi*r^2  / (2r)^2
#                                       = pi(1^2) / (2*1)^2, since r=1
#                                       = pi/4
#   so
#     pi = 4*(area of circle)/(area of square)
#        =~ 4*(#points in circle) / (#points in square)
# Value: an estimate of pi.
# Hints:
#   - ?runif tells how to get random coordinates in the range (-1, 1)
#   - You can see a picture like the required drawing at the top of
#     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_Integration. (Don&#39;t
#     worry if you don&#39;t understand the article, which isn&#39;t easy.)
#   - Using R&#39;s base graphics, you can plot the points via plot(x, y).
#   - One way to draw the circle is to get a sequence of angles (in
#     radians) from 0 to 2*pi, and then use x coordinate cos(angle)
#     and y coordinate sin(angle).</code></pre>

<h2 id="part-4-manage-a-grocery-list.">Part 4: Manage a grocery list.</h2>
<p>Write an R script called &quot;hw2grocery.R&quot; that helps with grocery shopping by running through a list of candidate groceries and their prices, getting user input on each item, and then making a shopping list. Here's a sample session run with a budget of ten dollars:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; source(&quot;hw2grocery.R&quot;)
          item price
1      spinach   2.0
2         rice   3.0
3 toilet paper   4.0
4        bread   2.4
5         milk   3.1
6        apple   0.4
How many spinach?
1: 2
How many rice?
1: 1
How many bread?
1: 1
How many apple?
1: 2
  ERROR: too many for the budget
How many apple?

     item price quantity
1 spinach   2.0        2
2    rice   3.0        1

4   apple   0.4        1
Your bill is $9.8
&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There are three pieces of code to write to solve Part 4.</p>
<h3 id="part-4.1-write-a-how.many-function">Part 4.1: write a how.many() function</h3>
<p>First, write a helper function, how.many, that takes two arguments, item (character string) and n.max (numeric). Display the prompt, &quot;How many item?&quot;, and then require the user to enter desired number of item, an integer between 0 and n.max. (Assume the user will enter a nonnegative integer.) If user enters a number larger than n.max, display the message, &quot; ERROR: too many for the budget&quot; and start again. Return the user's number. For example, the call how.many(&quot;apple&quot;, 4) prints &quot;How many apple?&quot; and returns a number chosen by the user between 0 and 4.</p>
<h3 id="part-4.2-write-a-grocery.list-function">Part 4.2: write a grocery.list() function</h3>
<p>Second, write a function, grocery.list, that takes two arguments, file (a character string file name) and budget (numeric). From file, read a grocery price list containing items and prices, like this:</p>
<pre><code>spinach,2.00
rice,3.00
toilet paper,4.00
bread,2.40
milk,3.10
apple,0.40</code></pre>
<p>Display the price list. Loop through it asking how many of each item should be purchased. (Use your how.many() function.)</p>
<p>budget is the maximum amount that can be spent. Do not accept a user's number of an item if it causes the budget to be exceeded. Do not display an item at all if its price is higher than the remaining budget.</p>
<p>Return a data frame consisting of three columns, &quot;item&quot;, &quot;price&quot;, and &quot;quantity&quot;, and those rows with nonzero quantities.</p>
<h3 id="part-4.3-call-your-grocery.list-function">Part 4.3: call your grocery.list() function</h3>
<p>Third, write a few lines of code to call your grocery.list() on a &quot;groceries.csv&quot; file with a budget of $10. Print the returned shopping list (data frame) along with the total bill, in a line of the form, &quot;Your bill is $n&quot;, where n is a number.</p>
<h3 id="part-4-grading-note">Part 4 grading note</h3>
<p>We'll grade this part of your homework by running source(&quot;hw2grocery.R&quot;) in a directory containing a &quot;groceries.csv&quot; grocery price list file (which may be different from the one you used), giving user input, checking your output, and reading your code. To make it possible partly to automate grading, your output strings should exactly match the specified output strings.</p>
